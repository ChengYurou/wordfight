A website tool for people who want to practice the word spelling and meaning by keyboard input repeatedly. It's something like *deliberate practice* because we will "write down" a word by typing on keyboard more frequently than by the pen in our hands. Especially for computer-based IELTS and TOEFL test.

All the features are managed by [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/eSRW3uHC/website-story-board).
