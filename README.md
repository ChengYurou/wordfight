A website tool for people who want to practice words spelling and its meaning by keyboard input repeatedly. It's something like *deliberate practice* because we will write down a word by typing on keyboard more frequently than by pens in our hands.

All the features are managed by [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/eSRW3uHC/website-story-board).

Welcome to post issues and features.
